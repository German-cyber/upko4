      <h3 className="about-us-title">OUR JOURNEY</h3>

      <p className="about-us-text">UPKO was officially founded in 2018, the founding team recognized the monotony of the adult products market, many BDSM products available were often disposable and low-quality, marked by harsh odors, rough edges, and designs reflecting a predominantly male perspective. While these products may serve some, those with a desire for imaginative and extraordinary, looking to enhance their sex games with high-quality and beautifully crafted items, deserved a better choice.</p>
      
      <p className="about-us-text">This is precisely the reason UPKO was founded.</p>


      <img src="/images/aboutus-2.webp" alt="" />

      <p className="about-us-text">Driven by a passionate team of primarily LGBTQ, UPKO embraces diversity, fostering a uniquely insightful perspective that enriches our products. Our mission is dedicated to crafting captivating sexual experiences tailored to meet a wide range of needs. With five years of steadfast commitment since our inception, UPKO remains steadfast in upholding the essence of supreme design while infusing our products with rich cultural attributes.</p>
      <p className="about-us-text">We utilize premium leather from Italy’s second-largest supplier, known for providing materials to luxury brands like Givenchy, and most of our metal parts are produced with customized molds.</p>

    <h3 className="about-us-title">A Stunning Debut</h3>

      <p className="about-us-text">In 2019, UPKO made a remarkable debut at the Shanghai ADCEXPO, an international adult industry exhibition. We unveiled our co-branding collection, "The Doll," which captivated professional buyers. Among this collection, the Rose Ball Gag emerged as the best seller, featuring a patented 3D modeling design crafted from Dow Corning silicone, ensuring both aesthetic appeal and safety.</p>
      <p className="about-us-text">Following this debut, UPKO gained significant attention in the niche market, inspiring us to explore new product series and enhance brand recognition through collaborations and offline events.</p>

    <h3 className="about-us-title">EXQUISITE CRAFTSMANSHIP</h3>


      <p className="about-us-text">All BDSM tools in our kits are made from premium cowhide imported from Italy, crafted by skilled artisans to ensure high quality and exceptional user experience. The metal components are custom-molded, with some pieces featuring gold-plated brass, offering a tangible sense of weight and precision.</p>
      <p className="about-us-text">Although UPKO initially established itself in the BDSM niche, we do not limit ourselves to any specific definition. Like traditional sex toys, our tools help everyone explore their bodies and intimate relationships, offering thoughtful assistance along the way.

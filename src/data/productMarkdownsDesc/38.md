The Spreader Bar comes from UPKO Classic Collection - [Paradise Regain Leather Collection](https://www.upkoofficialshop.com/collections/paradise-regain-leather-collection/products/leather-spreader-bar). The spreader bar acts as a controlled leg spreader. The 4 zinc alloy snap hook attachments serve as a means to connect the bar to handcuffs and ankle cuffs in order to keep the wearers arms/legs spread.

The spreader bar has a sturdy base, wrapped in soft leather. We highly recommend using this bar with our classic leather handcuffs and ankle cuffs.

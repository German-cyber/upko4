Description:

Love hurts though, a night with pain is bound to be beautiful.  
The metal hook for both the vagina and anus can be used together with the pearl collar, pearl bracelet, chain leash and ropes, etc.  
  
Primary usage:  
Put the ball end into the vagina and pass the chain leash or rope through the ring on the other side of the hook for fixation.  
  
Advanced usage:  
Lubricate the ball end, put it into the anus, and then pass the chain leash or rope through the ring on the other side of the hook for fixation.  
A small toy that stimulates your whole body with a gentle move.  
Connect the hook to other body parts for bondage. When your partner is in a certain position, a slight movement in posture will cause intense sensation to the private parts.  
  
Match with other items to use:  
Connect the hook with the pearl collar through the haulage chain to force your partner to look up.  
Connect the hook with the pearl bracelet to tie the hands of your partner.  
Pass the rope through the ring and make a fixed knot to connect the hook with other toys.  
Connect the hook to the leather belt through a double-head buckle or the rope to force your partner to kneel down.  
Connect the hook to the nipple clips through the haulage chain or the rope to cause multiple stimulus to your sensation-seeking partner.

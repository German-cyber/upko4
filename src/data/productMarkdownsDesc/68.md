Description:

Light to the night what your eyes to my heart.  
The splendor of starlight is what’s in your eyes.  
I saw your eyes when stars bleed into my nightfall/when I was lost within the day.  
Don’t your eyes have something to say to me?  
  
Bright as a dream, your moist eyes were sparkling pearly brilliance.  
A sea in the calm, your deep gaze settled on me and then vanished.  
You will hear the love of voice as the sun and the sky light the way.  
In spite of the ache, I will do it a thousand times again, for you.  
  
Implying sincerity and niceness, the big artificial pearls are shaped with exquisite techniques. A triangular elastic buckle is designed to connect the collar and the bracelet to allow for versatile dressing matches.  
The two bracelets can be hooked by the triangular elastic buckle.  
Wear them on both of your hands and lock yourself down.  
Wear them with your partner to never be parted again.

Two chains are designed to connect the anklet to the pearl collar, bracelets as well as metal hook for the exciting play.  
The two anklets can be hooked by the triangular elastic buckle by the end.

Description:

Light to the night what your eyes to my heart.  
The splendor of starlight is what’s in your eyes.  
I saw your eyes when stars bleed into my nightfall/when I was lost within the day.  
Don’t your eyes have something to say to me?  
  
Bright as a dream, your moist eyes were sparkling pearly brilliance.  
A sea in the calm, your deep gaze settled on me and then vanished.  
You will hear the love of voice as the sun and the sky light the way.  
In spite of the ache, I will do it a thousand times again, for you.  
  
Implying sincerity and niceness, the big artificial pearls are shaped with exquisite techniques. A triangular elastic buckle is designed to connect the collar and the bracelet to allow for versatile dressing matches.  
Wear the collar alone to spice up your daily sexiness and cuteness.  
Match it with the leash to embrace a convenient sex trip.

**Play scenario recommendations:**  
1\. Four feet up, carefree and playful!  
Handcuffs combine with thigh cuffs  
Secure both hands to each respective thigh, lying back and carefree, allowing the playful dominator to indulge. This position can be complemented by using the pinwheel to tickle the soles of the feet effortlessly, rendering the sub unable to resist.  
2\. Playful Seesaw  
Handcuffs combine with sling with choker and thigh cuffs  
This position tests sub's core strength. Both legs need to pass through the embrace of the hands, toes pointed, lifting high. The folded body sways—mustn't wobble in front of the dominator! An improper posture might warrant a genuine leather riding crop or whip as a “reward”.  
3\. Entry-level Hogtie  
Handcuffs combine with ankle cuffs  
The classic hogtie is an incredibly binding position. Quickly grasping this classic posture is delightful—no need for complicated binding; a simple click and hands and feet are bound in a basic hogtie. The sense of restraint and stimulation from limb restraint is profound. Adding UPKO's classic rose ball gag leaves one speechless and whimpering, creating an exquisitely picturesque scene.  
4\. The Classic Spread Eagle Position  
Handcuffs combine with ankle cuffs  
The epitome of classics, the Spread Eagle position comes in at least three variations: lying down, crawling or kneeling, and sitting. Both the lying down and sitting variations offer a full view, combining sense of shame with playfulness. Revealing the elegant limbs, tearing down the disguise to explore the uncharted territories. Pairing it with a Remote-control Wand Vibrator&Thigh Harness Combo is highly recommended for added excitement. The crawling or kneeling posture paired with a bunny tail butt plug begs for attention—who could resist?

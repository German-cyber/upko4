As the needle runs over the body, every inch of the skin got revitalized.  
The flooding numbness that comes with the burning desire  
is something you can never avoid in a punitive foreplay.  
Donâ€™t even think about running away, my little precious.  
It can be directly used anywhere on the body. Push it gently and stimulate the nerves for something sensational.  
Made in high-end zinc alloy, and electroplated with nickle-free and anti-allergy material.  
Going through multiple tests and running smoothly,  
the pinwheel works safely and skin-friendly  
and ensures a stimulating and thrilling game-play.  
And the specific aesthetics of the skid-proof handle  
is demonstrated by the concave-convex stripe design.

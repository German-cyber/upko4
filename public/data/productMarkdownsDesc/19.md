**Description:**   

A Mighty Entry for Conquest.

As the valiant knight wields the mighty lance, conquering battles with courage and valor, the sensation of the “lance”'s entry brings forth a unique sense of conquest.

Urethral Sound is not a punitive device, but rather a "boldness booster" in the realm of pleasure. So much so that it has been discreetly popular, leaving those in the know irresistibly intrigued.

  

This device has the power to delve deep, enabling a different method and angle for male climax. Every time it's used, it brings forth a cascade of crystalline "teardrops" of ecstasy.

Gently teasing, slow strokes, and playful flicks, like pearls dancing on a jade plate.

The correct stimulation technique is not confined to simply moving up and down. Try gently gripping, creating subtle vibrations, and slowly allowing the tip of the device to explore deep within, teasing and withdrawing. It's not about rushing for more; it's about delicately exploring. Once you've experienced it successfully, you'll understand that there's no turning back.

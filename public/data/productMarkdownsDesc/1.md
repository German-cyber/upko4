## Design

It's designed in a size of 860*170*315(mm). The combination lock not only can protect your privacy, also make it more portable, you can travel with it safely. The 4 metal corner protectors make the Sade Trunk classic and sturdy. It provides spotted leather fasteners to protect and store the products inside in a better way. The 4 drawers on the left side are perfect for extra storage with small pieces of accessories, but please check the size of drawer before you place order if you would like to place something big inside, since the space is limited designed for the consideration of the proper full size. For the right side, there are 6 metal hooks, suitable for the storage of SP tools and keep them in order.

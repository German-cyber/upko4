Description:

Delaying ejaculation physically!  
It is set at the root to slow down the blood flow. As the cavernosum puffs, ejaculation is stopped.  
A traditional cock ring is made of plastic and is difficult to wear due to a lack of elasticity. A single inner diameter size is too tight to fit the penis.  
UPKO cock ring employs the open and adjustable design idea.  
The elastic silicone rope is equipped with wavy lock joint with two fine adjustment beads. Pulling it, you can move it freely. Releasing it, itâ€™s fixed steadily.  
High-elasticity silicone  
Soft and resilient for comfortable wearing  
Soft but extremely stretchable, the silicone rope can be fixed at the desired position, neither loose nor tight.  
Wearing it will not hinder your performance but will help you have an unforgettable sex journey.  
Flexible posture and concavo-convex visual effect  
The versatile shapes can also be used for functions and postures to help you protrude to the desired position and find the most comfortable angle. Keep up the confidence and show the most perfect you to the partner!  
Two delicate brass adjustment beads for multiple creative reciprocation and pattern renovations  
Lightweight, portable and easy to store

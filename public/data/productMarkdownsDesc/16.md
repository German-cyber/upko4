Dive into a world of desire with the UPKO Pulling Chain Nipple Clamps. With an enhanced adjustable range, you can precisely control the level of pain, providing an ultimate personalized experience that balances beauty and intensity.

**Features**  
Exquisite embossed bow design, beautifully framing the alluring "scenery".  
Widened clamp area increases the pressure distribution, reducing discomfort for longer wear.  
The elegant curved design of the clamps fits snugly against the nipples.  
The textured nut increases friction, making it easier to twist.  
The adjustable chain features elegant curves that beautifully accentuate the contours of the chest. It is equipped with a refined leather buckle; by pushing the buckle, it transforms into a collar with a leash in seconds.

**How to Use**  
Simply pull down the elastic clip for easy wear, and twist the knob at the top to adjust the tightness.  
Tips: Adjust the top nut to the desired position before wearing it for added convenience during your next use.

**Recommended Play Scenarios**  
Lift both breasts using the chain necklace to enhance pain and visual stimulation. You can initiate a fun "rapid-fire Q&A" session, quickly releasing the tension if an incorrect answer is given, allowing your partner to experience the thrill of gravity.  
In addition to punishing wrong answers, you can also "accidentally" release the tension for a surprising twist!
